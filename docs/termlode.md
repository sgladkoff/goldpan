# The TermLode Application Family

The **TermLode** application family is a client-server, cloud-based terminology database solution designed for corporate use.

It is comprised of the following applications:

- The **TermLode** terminology database;
- The **Omnitran** Search application;
- The **Prospector** Terminology extractor;
- The **TermLode** Trados connector.

In the sense of architecture, it has the following components:

- The **TermLode** termbank;
- The **TermLode** Cloud Front End;
- The **Omnitran** Cloud Front End;
- The **Prospector** Cloud Front End;
- The **TermLode** **Trados** Connector DLL.






# Data Model

The **TermLode** data model conforms to the TBX standard (ISO 30042). There’s a **Concept** in the root of the hierarchy, and **Terms** in various languages descend from the root, as shown on the figure:

![termlode_f1](termlode_f1.png)

There's a One-to-Many relationship between a **Concept** and multiple **Terms** is any language, and a Many-to-Many relationship between **Terms** in different languages. This data model reflects the situation when one source term can have several terms for a target language and vice versa.






# Functionality







## TermLode

As you enter the **TermLode** page, the **Terminology Database Manager** will be the first screen you see. 

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_1.png)

This screen displays the list of all the **Termbases** available to you, grouped by company name. Company names, as well as the **Termbases**' own names, may be used to filter this list. Using the drop-down menu at the top of the frame, you can switch between it and the **Termbase** creation screen:

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_2.png)

You can simply enter the name of the new **Termbase**, pick the default source and target languages and press the **Create New Termbase** button. A new, empty **Termbase** will be created.

Click the name of a **Termbase** to enter the **Terminology Database** screen:

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_3.png)

The **Term Filter** takes up the top of the screen initially. With it, you can populate the **List of Terms** below, using any of the variables that make up a **Term** to filter the current **Termbase**:

- Source text and language;
- Target text and language;
- Business domains that terms belong to;
- Term types (acronym, concept etc.);
- Parts of speech that are used as terms;
- Prouducts that the terms belong to;
- Modules;
- DNT (Do Not Translate) status;
- Approval status;
- Client.

The **Apply Filter** button refreshes the **List of Terms** in accordance with the current **Term Filter** settings.

The **Term Filter** also includes the **Export** and **Export TBX** buttons that are used to create and download a XLSX or a TBX file respectively, containing the **Terms** from the filtered **List of Terms**.

The **List of Terms** will show a One-to-Many relationship between the source **Term** and the target **Terms** in multiple languages if the **Term Filter**  is set up for multiple target languages. When you click a source term in the **List of Terms**, the Edit dialog box opens and shows the full multilingual One-to-Many hierarhy - from the **Concept** down to the all its **Terms**, in various languages. You can add new synonym **Terms** in any of the languages already present, or select a new language for adding a **Term**:

The **+ New Term** button at the top right edge of the **Term Filter** calls a dialog window where you can define a new **Concept** and populate it with **Terms**. You are not limited in the number of **Terms** or the languages you can use.

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_7.png)

Selecting any number of **Terms** with the checkboxes on the left side of the **List of Terms** and pressing the **Delete Selected** button will delete them from the **Termbase**.

The drop-down menu over the **Term Filter** is used to switch the top frame between the **Term Filter** and other vital functions:

- The Settings menu, where you can set the name of the **Termbase**, as well as its default source and target languages and its business domain:

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_4.png)

- The Import menu, where you can import **Terms** via XLSX files (example file is provided via download link):

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_5.png)

- The Users menu, where you can see the list of uses that have been invited to this **Termbase** in various roles, as well as invite new users by sending invitation links to their email addresses:

## OmniTran

The **TermLode** data model organizes collections of **Terms** into **Glossaries** by client, as well as by topic. **OmniTran**, a global search front end web interface, enables you to carry out searches for a **Term** across multiple **Glossaries** at once.

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_8.png)

You can select just a single **Glossary** or source/target language, or any number of them at once. You can also view selected **Glossaries**, one at a time, as collections of alphabetical sections, by pressing the **A-Z** button:

## Prospector

**Prospector** is an automatic English terminology extraction tool with possibility to review and manually filter terminology candidates.

![termlode_add1](termlode_add_9.png)

You can use **Prospector** to extract **Terms** from a file (the TXT, HTM/HTML, DOC/DOCX XLF/XLIFF/SDXLIFF formats are supported) or from a webpage URL. Choose either option with the File/URL switch and then either copy and paste the web page address into the text box, or click on it to call the file selection dialog. Then, select any pre-existing **Glossaries** as well as processing options that you'd like to use, and press the **Extract Terminology** button. If you've selected any existing **glossaries**, any **terms** already present in them will not get extracted.

You will see the **Terminology Candidates** window, with all the extracted **Terms** arranged in a list. The list has an option to search for **Terms**, as well as one to save any checked **Terms** in an XLS file. All the terms that appeared more than once will be, by default, checked for saving.
